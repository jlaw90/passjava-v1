## HardJava (passjava.com v1)

A testing system that supports multi-choice and compilable code tests (see CompilableTests for some examples).

The test would run in an applet on the visitor's page, grab the test and questions from the server and display them to the user - sending the results back to the server.

Applets are now pretty much obsolete so have some source code!
